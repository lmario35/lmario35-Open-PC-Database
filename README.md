# Components Database Project

Welcome to the Components Database Project! This open-source initiative aims to provide a comprehensive and structured database of various computer components, including CPUs, GPUs, RAM, and more. The data is represented in JSON format to ensure ease of use, flexibility, and automation.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure where each component type has its own dedicated JSON file. The data is organized to be easily understandable, extensible, and ready for use in various applications such as benchmarking tools, hardware comparisons, or educational purposes.

### Key Folders

- `cpu/`: Contains all files related to CPUs.
- `gpu/`: Contains all files related to GPUs.
- `ram/`: Contains all files related to RAM.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for maintaining and working with the data.

## JSON Structure Overview

Each component type is represented by a structured JSON file, with fields capturing the key attributes. For example, a CPU entry contains information like brand, model, cores, threads, clock speeds, TDP, etc.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you want to add new components, improve the documentation, or help with validation, your help is appreciated.

### Contribution Guidelines

- Make sure to follow the existing data structure when adding new entries.
- Use a unique UUID for each new component entry.
- Update the last_modified field with the current date whenever you make changes.
